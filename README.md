# MyNeuralNetworks

This repository hosts various projects showcasing the implementation of **neural networks** in C++. These projects demonstrate the fundamental concepts of neural networks applied to logical operations and number recognition tasks.

## Neural Networks and Their Applications

Neural networks are computational models inspired by the human brain's structure and function. They consist of interconnected nodes (neurons) that process and transmit information. These networks are capable of learning patterns, making them invaluable in various fields such as pattern recognition, classification, and prediction.

### Projects Included:

1. **Neural_NetworkXOR**
    - Demonstrates a neural network for the XOR logical operation.

2. **Neural_NetworkAND**
    - Implements a neural network for the logical AND operation.

3. **Neural_NetworkOR**
    - Contains a neural network for the logical OR operation.

4. **Number_Recognition**
    - Focuses on recognizing numbers based on segmented display patterns using neural networks.
    - Utilizes three different network output methods: **7 to 1, 7 to 7, and 7 to 10**.

5. **Training_Network_BP**
    - Provides an implementation for training neural networks using **backpropagation**.

## Understanding Neural Networks

### Backpropagation

**Backpropagation** is a key algorithm used to train neural networks. It involves propagating the error backward through the network's layers to adjust the weights, minimizing the difference between the predicted and actual outputs. This iterative process allows neural networks to learn from data and improve their performance.

### Mean Squared Error (MSE)

**Mean Squared Error (MSE)** is a common metric used to evaluate the performance of neural networks during training. It measures the average squared difference between predicted and actual values. Minimizing the MSE during training is a primary goal to enhance the network's accuracy in making predictions.

## Sample Code: Number Recognition

The `Number_Recognition` project's source code (from `NeuralNetworks.cpp`) illustrates the process of training and recognition. This project showcases the application of neural networks in recognizing numbers based on segmented display patterns.
